# Crowdsourcing Learning as Domain Adaptation.

Code for ACL-IJCNLP 2021 paper: "[Crowdsourcing Learning as Domain Adaptation: A Case Study on Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14980)"

Coming soon!

I'm trying to rewrite the code with allennlp.

For the original experiment code, please refer to [crowd-NER](https://github.com/izhx/crowd-NER).
